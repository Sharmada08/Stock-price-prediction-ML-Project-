ML Project using ARIMA ( Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ) Model

• Designed and implemented a robust machine learning model, leveraging ARIMA methodology, to predict stock prices 
accurately. This model considered historical stock data for training and making predictions by observing primarily stock 
prices for a designated year, taking into account historical trends and patterns in the data.
• Historical stock price data was provided, including key features such as date, opening price, closing price, highest and 
lowest prices, trading volume, and more in dataset. We also utilized information on stock prices from previous years to 
enhance prediction accuracy.
• Model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 89%, providing reasonably reliable estimates based on historical trends 
and patterns.
